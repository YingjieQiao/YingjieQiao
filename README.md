### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yingjie, a software engineer based in Singapore.

I am a Final Year computer science student at Singapore University of Technology and Design ([SUTD](https://sutd.edu.sg/)), on track to graduate in Sept 2022. After graduation, I will be joining ByteDance Singapore to work on the Risk Management & Compliance solutions that support payment-related business in ByteDance / TikTok. 

You can learn more about me from [my portfolio here](https://yingjieqiao.github.io/) or from my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yingjie-qiao/).
